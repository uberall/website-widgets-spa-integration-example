# Integrating website-widgets into a single-page-application (SPA)

The uberall website-widgets work out of the box for server-side-rendered pages, but for single-page-applications there needs to be some manual configuration to make them work. This is often the case for websites which use popular frameworks like React, Vue.js or Angular.

This repo is an example app to showcase how to integrate the widgets inside a React app.

## How to start the app

- add your website-widgets-key and `locationId` to the [widgets component](https://github.com/uberall/website-widgets-spa-integration-example/blob/main/src/routes/RouteWithWebsiteWidgets.js)

- in the project directory, to install the packages, run `npm install`

- in the project directory, to start the example app, run: `npm start`

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the example page in your browser.
